Albitron-PTH2O 🌋
A Machine Learning-Based Geothermobarometer with a User-Friendly GUI

Welcome to the official repository for Albitron-PTH2O. This software provides a robust, machine learning-driven approach for petrologists and volcanologists to accurately estimate crystallization pressure (P), temperature (T), and melt water content (H2O) from mineral-melt equilibrium data.

While traditional empirical models often struggle with complex, non-linear geological datasets, Albitron-PTH2O leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to improve predictive accuracy across various volcanic systems.

Key Features:

High Accuracy: Trained on comprehensive experimental petrology datasets to robustly predict P-T-H2O conditions.

User-Friendly GUI: No coding experience required. We provide standalone executable applications (for both macOS and Windows) equipped with an intuitive graphical interface.

Open Source & Reproducible: The core machine learning model (.pkl) and data processing scripts (Python/pandas/scikit-learn) are fully accessible for transparent peer review and future community development.

(Note: This software is currently under peer review at JGR: Solid Earth. A detailed methodology and case studies validating the model will be available in the upcoming publication.)
