# Albitron-PTH2O 🌋
**A Machine Learning-Based Geothermobarometer with a User-Friendly GUI**

Welcome to the official repository for **Albitron-PTH2O**. This software provides a robust, machine learning-driven approach for petrologists and volcanologists to accurately estimate crystallization pressure (P), temperature (T), and melt water content (H2O) from mineral-melt equilibrium data. 

While traditional empirical models often struggle with complex, non-linear geological datasets, Albitron-PTH2O leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to improve predictive accuracy across various volcanic systems.

## ✨ Key Features
* **High Accuracy:** Trained on comprehensive experimental petrology datasets to robustly predict P-T-H2O conditions.
* **User-Friendly GUI:** No coding experience required. We provide standalone executable applications (for macOS and Windows) equipped with an intuitive graphical interface.
* **Open Source & Reproducible:** The core machine learning model (`.pkl`) and data processing scripts are fully accessible for transparent peer review and future community development.

*(Note: This software is currently under peer review at JGR: Solid Earth. A detailed methodology and case studies validating the model will be available in the upcoming publication.)*

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Option 1: Using the Standalone GUI Application (Recommended)
If you just want to use the tool without setting up a Python environment, you can download the pre-packaged application:
1. Go to the **Releases** page of this repository (look at the right sidebar).
2. Download the appropriate version for your operating system (`.app.zip` for macOS or `.exe` for Windows).
3. Extract the downloaded file and double-click the application to launch the GUI.
4. Load your dataset and start predicting!

### Option 2: Running from Python Source (For Developers)
If you want to run the code directly or modify the model:
